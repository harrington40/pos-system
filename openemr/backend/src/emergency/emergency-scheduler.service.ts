/**
 * The emergency safety sweep.
 *
 * Every few minutes: escalate anyone who has waited past their target (which
 * also pages their nurse) and chase observations that have gone past their
 * level's reassessment interval. This is the part of the design that rescues a
 * neglected patient — the queue order deliberately never lets waiting time
 * outrank a sicker patient, so being overlooked has to be *noticed*, not
 * silently reordered.
 *
 * Ticks every 5 minutes rather than the 15 used by the billing and mailbox jobs:
 * a 10-minute target has a 5-minute grace, so a 15-minute tick could leave a
 * chest-pain patient sitting ~20 minutes past their target before anyone is
 * told. The check is a single indexed query, and both actions are guarded per
 * visit, so a frequent tick cannot escalate or page twice.
 *
 * Style mirrors `BillingIntegrityService` / `MailboxSchedulerService`: a
 * dependency-free interval plus a boot check. @nestjs/schedule is not installed
 * and the deploy ships dist/ only.
